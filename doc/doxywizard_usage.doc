/*! \page doxywizard_usage Doxywizard usage

The doxywizard is a GUI front-end for configuring and running doxygen. 

It is possible to start the doxywizard with as argument the configuration file to be used or
without a configuration file meaning to start with the default settings.

When you start the doxywizard it will display the main window 
(the actual look depends on the OS used).

\image html doxywizard_main.png "Main window"
\image latex doxywizard_main.png "Main window" width=15cm

The Gui consists of the following parts:
<dl>
<dt>Specify the working directory from which doxygen will run<dd>In case the doxywizard is started
with a configuration file or a doxygen configuration file is loaded by means of an open command
(see: \ref dw_menu_file) the directory of this settings file is used as default for this setting.
<!--
<dt>Configure doxygen using the Wizard and/or Expert tab, then switch to the Run tab to generate the documentation<dd>&nbsp;
-->
<dt>Available dialogs<dd>
Note that you can select multiple tabs in a row, for instance to first 
configure doxygen using the \ref dw_wizard and then fine tune the settings via 
the \ref dw_expert.
<dl>
<dt>\ref dw_wizard <dd>in this tab it is possible to quickly configure the most
                       important settings and leave the rest of the options to
                       their defaults.
<dt>\ref dw_expert <dd>in this tab one gains access to the \ref config
                       "full range of configuration options".
<dt>\ref dw_run <dd>in this tab it is possible to run doxygen and view the used settings for doxygen.
</dl>
<dt>\ref dw_menu <dd> In the menu bar the following parts are available: 
\ref dw_menu_file, \ref dw_menu_settings and \ref dw_menu_help.
</dl>

After doxygen is configured you need to save (see: \ref dw_menu_file) the configuration as a file
to disk. This step allows doxygen to use the configuration 
and has the additional advantage that the configuration can be reused 
to run doxygen with the same settings at a later point in time.

Since some configuration options may use relative paths, be sure to
select a directory from which to run doxygen. This is typically the root
of the source tree and will most of the time already be filled in correctly.

Once the configuration file is saved and the working directory is set, you
can run doxygen based on the selected settings. Do this by pressing the
"Run doxygen" button (in the \ref dw_run tab). Once doxygen runs you can cancel it by clicking the same
button again. The output produced by doxygen is captured and shown in the "Output produced by doxygen"
pane. Once doxygen finishes, the log can be saved as a text file.

\section dw_wizard Wizard dialog

The Wizard dialog has a number of sub-panes:
<dl>
<dt>Left sub-pane<dd>The main topics for easy setting up doxygen.
By clicking on a topic the corresponding settings will appear in the Right
sub-pane.
<dt>Right sub-pane<dd>The wizard settings sub-pane, in this pane you will find the
settings that are available for the selected topic.
</dl>

The wizard only gives the possibility to quickly setup doxygen, for full control
one should use the \ref dw_expert.

\subsection dw_wizard_project Project settings

The fields in the Project sub-pane speak for themselves. Once doxygen has finished
the Destination directory is where to look for the results. Doxygen will
put each output format in a separate sub-directory.

\forceNewPage
\subsection dw_wizard_mode Mode of operating

The Mode sub-pane allows you to select how doxygen will look at your sources.
The default is to only look for things that have been documented. Furthermore the
terminology of the output can be selected by means of the terminology of the
main computer language used (this doesn't affect the way doxygen parses your source code).

\subsection dw_wizard_output Output to produce

The Output sub-pane allows you to select what kinds of output doxygen will produce.
For HTML and \LaTeX there are additional options available.

\subsection dw_wizard_diagrams Diagrams to generate

Doxygen can produce a number of diagrams. Using the Diagrams sub-pane you
can select which ones to generate. For most diagrams the 
`dot` tool of the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> package
is needed.

\image html doxywizard_page4.png "Wizard dialog: Diagrams to generate"
\image latex doxywizard_page4.png "Wizard dialog: Diagrams to generate" width=15cm

\section dw_expert Expert dialog

The Expert dialog has a number of sub-panes:
<dl>
<dt>Top left sub-pane<dd>The topics sub-pane (i.e. sections in the
configuration file) that are available. By clicking on a topic the
corresponding settings will appear in the Right sub-pane.
<dt>Bottom left sub-pane<dd>The help sub-pane, this will be updated when one
hovers over the name of a setting in the Right sub-pane.
<dt>Right sub-pane<dd>The settings sub-pane, in this pane you will find the
settings that are available for the selected topic. In case a setting appears
with its name in red it means that the setting doesn't contain the default
setting. In case a setting is grayed out it means that the setting is depending
on another setting as indicated in the Bottom left sub-pane.
</dl>

\image html doxywizard_expert.png "Some options from the Expert dialog"
\image latex doxywizard_expert.png "Some options from the Expert dialog" width=15cm

The kind of input field depends on the type of the configuration option. 
<ul>
<li>For each boolean option (those options that are answered with `YES` or 
    `NO` in the configuration file) there is a check-box. A typical field
    would look like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_bool.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_bool.png width=4.6cm
<li>For items taking one of a fixed set of values (like 
    \ref cfg_output_language "OUTPUT_LANGUAGE") a combo box is used.
    A typical field would look like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_enum.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_enum.png width=7.3cm
<li>For items taking an integer value from a range, a spinbox is used.
    A typical field would look like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_int.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_int.png width=10.1cm
<li>For free form string-type options there is a one line edit field.
    A typical field would look like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_string_string.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_string_string.png width=12.3cm
    <br>Additionally when the string field should contain a file or a folder name, there are the special buttons 
    \image{inline} html images/file.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/file.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    and
    \image{inline} html images/folder.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/folder.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    that start a file / folder selection dialog.
    A typical field would look like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_string_file.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_string_file.png width=11.0cm
    <br>and<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_string_dir.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_string_dir.png width=11.0cm
    <br>In case of the file possibility we have a special case when the file
    should be an image. In that case the same field as for a file is shown, but
    doxygen also tries to display the selected image.
    A typical field would look like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_string_image.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_string_image.png width=11.8cm
<li>For options taking a list of strings, a one line edit field is 
    available, with a
    \image{inline} html images/add.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/add.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    button to add this string to the list and a
    \image{inline} html images/del.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/del.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    button to remove the selected string from the list. There 
    is also a 
    \image{inline} html images/refresh.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/refresh.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    button that, when pressed, replaces the selected item in the list with the string entered in the edit field. 
    A typical field would look like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_list_string.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_list_string.png width=11.2cm
    <br>additionally when the list contains file and / or folder entries, there are special buttons 
    \image{inline} html images/file.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/file.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    and
    \image{inline} html images/folder.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/folder.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    that start a file / folder selection dialog.
    A typical field would look like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_list_file.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_list_file.png width=11.2cm
    <br>and<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_list_dir.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_list_dir.png width=11.2cm
    <br>and in case of files and folders:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_list_filedir.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_list_filedir.png width=11.9cm
</ul>

\section dw_run Run dialog

The run dialog gives the possibility to run doxygen with the given settings, see the HTML results, see the settings used and save the ouput as displayed in the output pane.
